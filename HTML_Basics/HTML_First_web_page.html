       <p><strong></strong> Cars </strong></p><body></body></i>  I like cars, they are cool and I want to own a lot of them. I want to own some super cool and expensive cars but also some normal and not so expensive cars. My favorite car that I know I can actualy get one day is a Mercedes Benz Maybach S 680 4Matic. It starts at 240k but with the spec I want I got it up to 260k. It is super luxurious and comfortable, I like going fast but not always. I like bikes but ever since I was a lil kid, I liked cars more. Cars are really fun and I have been in some super cars and ever hypercars. I went for a ride in a Buggati and we raced a Nissan GTR which was upgraded and had 2000 horsepower. The GTR was ahead for a little but the Buggati with its quad turbos caught up. I went to a car show for classic cars and saw many cool cars and huge turbos and superchargers and there was a truck that was super loud. My dream car that is super expensive is a Pagani Huayra Codalunga. It is a hypercar with 829 horsepower and a top speed of 230mph and can go 0-62 in 3.1 seconds. All of that speed and power doesnt come cheap, the car costs $7.4 million. Another car close to the Pagani Huayra Codalunga is the Pagani Imola. It has 850 horsepower and has a top speed of 217mph. It goes 0-62 in 2.9 seconds. </p>
