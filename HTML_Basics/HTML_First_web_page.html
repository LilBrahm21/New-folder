       <p><strong></strong> Cars </strong></p><body></body></i>  I like cars, they are cool and I want to own a lot of them. I want to own some super cool and expensive cars but also some normal and not so expensive cars. My favorite car that I know I can actualy get one day is a Mercedes Benz Maybach S 680 4Matic. It starts at 240k but with the spec I want I got it up to 260k. It is super luxurious and comfortable </p>
