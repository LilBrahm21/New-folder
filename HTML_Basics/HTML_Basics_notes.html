Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took <b>a galley of type and scrambled</b> it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p><h3>Header3</h3>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
