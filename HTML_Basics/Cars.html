                <h2>Favorite Cars</h2> 
                <div id="two">
                <p>I like cars, they are cool and I want to own a lot of them. I want to own some super cool and expensive cars but also some normal and not so expensive cars. My favorite car that I know I can actualy get one day is a Mercedes Benz Maybach S 680 4Matic. It starts at 240k but with the spec I want I got it up to 260k. It is super luxurious and comfortable, I like going fast but not always. I like bikes but ever since I was a lil kid, I liked cars more. Cars are really fun and I have been in some super cars and ever hypercars. I went for a ride in a Bugatti and we raced a Nissan GTR which was upgraded and had 2000 horsepower. The GTR was ahead for a little but the Bugatti with its quad turbos caught up. I went to a car show for classic cars and saw many cool cars and huge turbos and superchargers and there was a truck that was super loud. My dream car that is super expensive is a Pagani Huayra Codalunga. It is a hypercar with 829 horsepower and a top speed of 230mph and can go 0-62 in 3.1 seconds. All of that speed and power doesnt come cheap, the car costs $7.4 million. Another car close to the Pagani Huayra Codalunga is the Pagani Imola. It has 850 horsepower and has a top speed of 217mph. It goes 0-62 in 2.9 seconds.</p>

                <h2> Cars Special to me </h2> 
                <div id="three">
                <p>Even though I want thoes cars really bad, there are some cars that are special to me. I grew up with cars and started learning about them at the age of 3. I could name almost every car on the street at the age of 4 and have been interested ever since. I also started liking bikes after getting my first dirtbike which is a 2024 Yamaha YZ250FX. I really like it and it is super fun. It is sometimes super dangerous too but if you are causious then you will be fine. I love going riding with my firends and we race and go on jumps. I always win becasue I have the biggest bike but a few of my friends are finally getting 250s so they can keep up with me. Even though they think they will beat me after they get 250s, Im getting a 450 so they will always lose. Going back to cars, the Mercedes Benz G63, it is a suv and it is very dear to my heart. I like how they preform and sound. It looks kind of like a box with a rectange in the front with wheels, but I like it. It is a high-performance, luxurious SUV produced by Mercedes-AMG with a 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine with 577 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. It accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and has a top speed of 137 mph. The G63 has a curb weight of around 5,800 lbs and offers a fuel economy of 14 mpg city and 16 mpg highway. Another car that is special to me is the Bugatti that i talked about in the last paragraph. It was the first hypercar that I ever sat in and it was one the of most amazing moments of my life. It was one of the most fun days ever and I was thrilled to hae sat in such and expensive, fast, and cool looking car. It has the maximum power output of 1,200 PS (882 kW; 1,183 bhp) at 6,400 rpm and a maximum torque of 1,500 N⋅m (1,100 lb⋅ft) at 3,000-5,000 rpm.</p>
